# Alternating-Direction-Implicit-ADI-for-2d-Heat-Equation

## Introduction 

This is the Matlab implemention of the ADI for 2d heat equaiton. 

The main implementation is under the file ADI2.m

In order to show the error log-log and tables, you also need to download the files related to "error", which are from Randy LeVeque's website. The correspoding textbook is called "Finite Difference Methods for Ordinary and Partial Differential Equations".

## Mathematical Part

The methematical derivation is in the .pdf file. The stability analysis for this 2d problem is out of the scope of this course. However, I also include a brief description of basic steps of Von Neumann Analysis to this multi-step 2d method. This part of the analysis can be found on Trefethen's website

## Fun Fact about Trefethen is that he came up with BMI formula!!!
